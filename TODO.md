--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Hard / Long

- Deciding on the experience-level progression
- proper HELP menu(s)
- item class definition
    - weapon sub-class 
    - armor sub-class
        - deeper-system definition:
            arms, legs, feet, torso, head, shoulders, back, 
    - usable items
        - potions
        - candles
        - torches
        - etc
    - weight
        - actually manage the weight in a game-balancing way so that you can't just pick up infinite items

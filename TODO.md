## Bugfixes


## Easy 
- quit message window advertising the game, the github, my website, etc
- actually get this up on github


## Medium
- Move code like "handle_input" into the Game class so that we reduce dependency on 'tools.py'
- Basic dungeon crafting
    - Define a room
- Camera movement mode
    - press 'c' to enter camera mode, or something
- Basics of a shell/terminal for longer commands and debugging

## Hard / Long

    - usable items
        - potions
        - candles

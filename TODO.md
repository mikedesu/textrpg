## Bugfixes Needed

- When an enemy makes attack contact with you, need to log that event
- Hitting 'Exit' on the ItemPickupMenu currently consumes a turn...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Easy 

- Debug panel that can be turned on/off and displays variables

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Medium

- Shields
- Equipping Weapons and Shields
- Basic NPC Movement
    - intelligent movement
    - movement "strategies"
- Basic dungeon crafting
    - Define a room
- Basics of a shell/terminal for longer commands and debugging
- Add the properties for handling turn priority
    - based off of Dexterity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Hard / Long

- proper HELP menu(s)
- lighting system
    - PC / NPC light radius / visibility
    - light coming off of torches and other light sources
- item class definition
    - weapon sub-class 
    - armor sub-class
        - deeper-system definition:
            arms, legs, feet, torso, head, shoulders, back, 
    - usable items
        - potions
        - candles
        - torches
        - etc
    - weight
        - actually manage the weight in a game-balancing way so that you can't just pick up infinite items
